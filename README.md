# This is a Discussion Forum Project for a SoftUni course using ReactJS. Below are the dependencies needed in order for the project to run properly.

- Install react bootstrap - npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
- Install firebase
- Install react-router-dom

## The project uses firebase as an authentication service, NoSQL database and storage. It's setup so that users can register and login. By logging in they can post replies to existing topics or create topics of their own. Users have the power to change their profile picture and email as well as delete only their own posts or comments, as well as edit their comment.I've also added an admin role (currently only me), that can delete any comment or post.
